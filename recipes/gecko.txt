Dan's Meatloaf
--------------

Time: 1 hour
Servings: 8


Ingredients:
1 cup Whole Milk
2 pounds Ground Beef
6 slices White Bread
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
4 whole Eggs, Beaten
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
3/4 teaspoons Salt
1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
Tabasco To Taste
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
3. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
4. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
9. Pour 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the bacon. Spread with a spoon.
10. Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes.
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
